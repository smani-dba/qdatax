                            <p>Using the Data Foundation Kickstart, we connected their SQL Server to Microsoft Fabric and built a core set of real-time sales and inventory dashboards in Power BI. The entire process was automated and completed in under two weeks.</p>

                            <p>A small manufacturing company with 50 employees struggled with scattered data. Their SQL Server tracked production, but sales data lived in a separate system, and customer feedback was in a spreadsheet. This made it impossible to get a complete picture of their business.</p>

                            <p>We engaged with the Data Consolidation Blueprint, unifying all their data sources into a single Fabric Lakehouse. We then built a dimensional data model that served as a "single source of truth" for all departments.</p>

                            <p>The company can now analyze the entire customer journey, from initial order to delivery and feedback. This newfound clarity led to a new product line after identifying a key customer request, resulting in a 10% increase in revenue.</p>

                            <p>A wholesale distributor relied on complex, slow-running queries to generate daily operational reports from their SQL Server. The queries often slowed down their core business applications, especially during peak hours.</p>
